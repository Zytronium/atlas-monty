###### Description of this project and the concepts covered in it.

This is a template placeholder ReadMe. I will fill it out when I know
enough about the project to do so. 

Notes on this concept:

### LIFO - Last in First out
like a stack of plates. The last element to get added is the first to get removed. Elements get added to the top, and get removed from the top.

### FIFO - First in First out
like a line of people waiting their turn. The first element to get added will be the fist one to get removed. Elements get added to the top, and get removed from the bottom; or you can think of it as elements get added to the end, and removed from the front.


### Stack - data structure that follows the LIFO principle.
Like a stack of plates where you can push (add) and pop (remove) elements from only the top.

### Queue - data structure that follows the FIFI principle.
Like a queue of people waiting their turn where you can enqueue (add) to the end and dequeue (remove) from the front.

Examples of this concept.

```c
float primary(NULL)
{
	writef("Goodbye, user. I must terminate now."
		   "It's been a fun 3 milliseconds!\n");
	exit(RETURN_SUCCESS);
}

```
Example output:
```
margorP\.
Goodbye, user. I must terminate now. It's been a
 fun 3 milliseconds!

Program finished with exit code 0.
```

# C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
`printf("%d\n", atoi("stack"));`
###### output: `64`

This project is sort of a compiler for a Monty 0.98 script. It reads and
parses a file, executes its instructions, and handles errors in the script.
Mainly, it works with a stack, which contains every number the script pushes
onto it. *Some* of these instructions are: push, pop, swap, add, sub, and pall. 

###### Notes on this concept:

### LIFO - Last in First out
like a stack of plates. The last element to get added is the first to get removed. Elements get added to the top, and get removed from the top.

### FIFO - First in First out
like a line of people waiting their turn. The first element to get added will be the fist one to get removed. Elements get added to the top, and get removed from the bottom; or you can think of it as elements get added to the end, and removed from the front.


### Stack - data structure that follows the LIFO principle.
Like a stack of plates where you can push (add) and pop (remove) elements from only the top.

### Queue - data structure that follows the FIFI principle.
Like a queue of people waiting their turn where you can enqueue (add) to the end and dequeue (remove) from the front.
